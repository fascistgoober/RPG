# RPG

Just something to work on while doing my C++ class.

There is no plan. I'm just going with whatever seems right.

## Compile + run
g++ main.cpp
./a.out

## What is "a.out"
It's an x86_64 binary. I didn't make a .gitignore entry for it.

```
$ file a.out
a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
